\section{Consider the searching problem}


Input: A sequence of n numbers = A = (a1,a2,..,an) and a value v.

Output: An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not appear in A.

Write pseudocode for linear search? which scans through the sequence? looking for v/ Using a loop inveriant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fullfills the three necessary properties.
